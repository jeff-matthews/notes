We no longer use the MAGEDOC project for internal reporting. Doc issues must be reported either in GitHub or (if sensitive and should not be public for some reason) in the Jira project specific to the doc domain.

For example:

Cloud docs = MCLOUD
Page Builder docs = PB
B2B docs = B2B
PWA docs = PWA
MBI docs = MBI
Product recommendations docs = DATA
Order management docs = PD
Amazon Sales Channels docs = CHAN
MFTF docs = MQE
All other Magento Commerce/Open Source docs = MC
