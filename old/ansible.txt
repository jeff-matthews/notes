1. Install ansible with pip (https://bitbucket.org/affinipay/ansible-docs-deploy/overview)
2. Set up environment variables:
  - sudo vi ~/.profile (use this naming convention)
    - export QA_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your ID>
    - export QA_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<Your key>
  - env (to confirm; should see keys)

I don't have sufficient permissions to take snapshots, but that's ok because that's only really useful for prod and only devops fools with that

If after installing ansible you don't have a default ansible.cfg, use jeffs

To test the script without deploying anything, add the --check flag:
  ansible-playbook docs_deploy.yml --i inventory/servers --limit 'docs-qa' --check

To deploy:
  ansible-playbook docs_deploy.yml --i inventory/servers --limit 'docs-qa'

To deploy in verbose mode, add the -vvv flag:
  ansible-playbook docs_deploy.yml --i inventory/servers --limit 'docs-qa' -vvv
