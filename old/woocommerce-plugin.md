## Installation

Our plugin was delisted from the official WordPress plugin directory, so the only installation method is manual. When we get it relisted, we need to update the README accordingly. Here's some example text:

### Automatic installation
Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don't need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of WooCommerce, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the **Plugins** menu and click **Add New**.

In the search field, type “_ChargeIO for WooCommerce_” and click **Search Plugins**. When you find our plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating, and description. Most importantly, of course, you can install it by simply clicking **Install Now**.

### Manual installation
The manual installation method involves downloading this plugin and uploading it to your webserver. Refer to [Manual Plugin Installation](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation) for instructions.

## Upgrade Notice
This plugin should automatically update with new features, but you can also download new versions and manually update the same way you would manually install.
